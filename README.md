# Network Simulation with Packet Tracer

## üåê Overview
This project is a **network simulation** created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, demonstrating the implementation of multiple routing protocols, dynamic IP allocation, and access control mechanisms. The simulation connects different networks using **OSPF, RIP, and EIGRP**, while **DHCP servers** dynamically assign IPs to end devices. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** are used to regulate network traffic and enhance security.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** for network simulation
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** for inter-network communication
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** for dynamic routing
- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** for efficient routing
- **DHCP Server** for automatic IP address assignment
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** for network security

## üîß Project Features
- **Multi-Protocol Routing:** Implements OSPF, RIP, and EIGRP to connect different networks.
- **Dynamic IP Assignment:** Uses DHCP to assign IP addresses automatically.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Enhances security by restricting unauthorized access.
- **Efficient Packet Forwarding:** Ensures optimized path selection for data transfer.
- **Subnetting and IP Configuration:** Organizes the network efficiently using IP subnetting.

## üìÇ Network Components
- **Routers** configured with multiple protocols (OSPF, RIP, EIGRP)
- **Switches** for interconnecting network segments
- **DHCP Server** for automatic IP allocation
- **End devices (PCs, Laptops, Servers)** assigned IPs dynamically
- **Access Control Lists** applied to routers for traffic control

## üöÄ How to Run the Simulation
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Load the provided `.pkt` file.
3. Start the simulation mode to observe packet forwarding.
4. Test network connectivity using the **ping** command.
5. Verify routing tables and DHCP IP assignments.
6. Analyze ACLs by testing access permissions.

## üìù Conclusion
This project effectively demonstrates the integration of different routing protocols and network services within a simulated environment. By implementing **OSPF, RIP, EIGRP, DHCP, and ACLs**, the network achieves optimized routing, dynamic IP allocation, and enhanced security.
